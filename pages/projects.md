# Writing and Projects

I write about science, innovation, forecasting, and other things on my blog, [The BS Detector](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/).

I made a little [web-thing to play Boggle](https://benshindel.github.io/boggle/) with your friends that works while lying flat on the table on your phone or tablet (random-directional tiles) unlike every other Boggle app online.

I also made a [puzzle game](https://benshindel.github.io/scarynumbers) inspired by the TV show Severance.

I'm working on a methodology for [ranking journals](https://benshindel.github.io/journal-ranking/) through the revealed preference of academics from elite institutions.
