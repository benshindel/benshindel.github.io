# Quantification and Remediation of Nanoplastics

In collaboration with lead author Jeremy Wang, as well as Caroline Harms and John Hegarty, two other members of my lab group, we worked to understand a process by which polyelectrolyte complexes sequester nanoplastic contaminants in water.

â€‹I also worked to test the adsorption of lead to the nanoplastics to observe the process by which nanoplastics, during the polyelectrolyte complex sequestration process, can also pull out other contaminants from water with them.

This work was published in [_ACS Langmuir_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c01028).
