# Moisture-Swing Carbon Capture

Our work on developing new sorbents for a moisture-swing modality of carbon capture was published in [_Environmental Science & Technology_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c02543). This type of carbon capture allows for the capture of CO2 under one humidity condition, and its release under another. In particular, our research expands the library of ions available for this process. I presented on my research in carbon capture at ACS Spring 2022 in San Diego in the Environmental Chemistry division, and at ACS Fall 2023 in San Francisco in the Energy & Fuels Division. Check out a [press release](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2023/10/pulling-carbon-dioxide-straight-from-the-air/) on the work as well. 

Research on expanding the moisture-swing modality to other material systems, including dual-functional materials for carbon capture and conversion, is currently accepted and due to be published in _Environmental Science & Technology_ in March, 2025. This article will discuss leveraging materials like activated carbon, nanostructured graphite, iron oxide, and alumina nanoparticles for moisture-swing carbon capture.
