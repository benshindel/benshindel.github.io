# Writing and Projects

I write about science, innovation, forecasting, and other things on my blog, [The BS Detector](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/).  I also write a weekly newsletter for Manifold Markets, called [Above the Fold](https://news.manifold.markets/). Some of my favorite things I've written recently are:
- [AI, Materials, and Fraud, Oh My!](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/ai-materials-and-fraud-oh-my) | May 2025
- [Predicting Leo](https://news.manifold.markets/p/predicting-leo) | May 2025
- [One Alienâ€™s Trash is Another Alienâ€™s Treasure](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/one-aliens-trash-is-another-aliens) | April 2025
- [The Signal and the Denoiser](https://news.manifold.markets/p/the-signal-and-the-denoiser) | Mar 2025
- [Dark, Dark Oxygen](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/dark-dark-oxygen) | Feb 2025
- [ðŸŽµ Heâ€™s Making a PlasticList, Heâ€™s Checking it Twiceâ€¦ ðŸŽµ](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/hes-making-a-plasticlist-hes-checking) | Jan 2025

I made a little [web-thing to play Boggle](https://benshindel.github.io/boggle/) with your friends that works while lying flat on the table on your phone or tablet (random-directional tiles) unlike every other Boggle app online.

I also made a [puzzle game](https://benshindel.github.io/scarynumbers) inspired by the TV show Severance.

I'm working on a methodology for [ranking journals](https://benshindel.github.io/journal-ranking/) through the revealed preference of academics from elite institutions.
