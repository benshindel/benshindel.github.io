# Writing and Projects

I write about science, innovation, forecasting, and other things on my blog, [The BS Detector](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/).  I also write a weekly newsletter for Manifold Markets, called [Above the Fold](https://news.manifold.markets/). Some of my favorite things I've written recently are:
- [Government-Funded Alchemy](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/government-funded-alchemy) Jul 2025
- [Manifold vs the World](https://news.manifold.markets/p/manifold-vs-the-world) Jul 2025
- [The Cognitive Debt of Digging Through Preprints](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/the-cognitive-debt-of-digging-through) Jun 2025
- [AI, Materials, and Fraud, Oh My!](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/ai-materials-and-fraud-oh-my)  May 2025
- [Predicting Leo](https://news.manifold.markets/p/predicting-leo)  May 2025

 Jan 2025

I made a little [web-thing to play Boggle](https://benshindel.github.io/boggle/) with your friends that works while lying flat on the table on your phone or tablet (random-directional tiles) unlike every other Boggle app online.

You can also play my Manifest 2025 choose-your-own-adventure story called [You are a NYT Journalist. Can you survive Manifest and get your scoop?](https://www.benshindel.com/manifest.html).

I also made a [puzzle game](https://benshindel.github.io/scarynumbers) inspired by the TV show Severance.

I'm working on a methodology for [ranking journals](https://benshindel.github.io/journal-ranking/) through the revealed preference of academics from elite institutions.
