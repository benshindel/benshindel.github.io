# Phosphate Recovery with the PEARL Membrane

The Phosphate Elimination and Recovery Lightweight (PEARL) Membrane is a sustainable solution to the [problem of phosphate pollution](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/phosphorus-pollution-fertilizer/617937/) and hypereutrophication.  A cellulose sponge, coated with a nanomaterial slurry, can recover phosphorus, an essential nutrient, from wastewater.

​Working under lead author Stephanie Ribet, our work is published in [_PNAS_](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2102583118) and reported on by [Anthropocene](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2021/06/a-nanoscale-solution-to-a-gigaton-problem/), [New Atlas](https://newatlas.com/environment/adaptable-sponge-phosphate-polluted-waterways-reuse/), and the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9637929/Scientists-create-sponge-soak-phosphate-reused.html).

​We more recently continued the testing of the PEARL membrane at larger scales to bridge the gap between lab-scale science and field-scale technology.  Working under lead author Kelly Matuszewski, our work on utilizing pH to differentially recover metals and nutrients concurrently from stormwater is published in [_ES&T Water_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.4c01234) and reported on by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauriewinkless/2025/02/12/specialist-sponge-captures-valuable-minerals-from-polluted-storm-water/).
