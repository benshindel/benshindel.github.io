# Collaborative Scientific Work

Working under lead author Nishithan Kani, I worked on characterizing and imaging cobalt oxide nanoclusters on graphene, used for the electrochemical reduction of nitrates with an extremely high selectivity for ammonia.  Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted to better understand the structure of the material and the cobalt oxide.  This work was reported in [_Advanced Energy Materials_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aenm.202204236).
