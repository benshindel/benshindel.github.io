# Nanomaterial Sponge Coatings for Heavy Metal Remediation and Nutrient Recovery

After the previous successes of my lab group in using sponge nanocomposites for oil spill remediation and nutrient recovery, I worked on designing nanomaterial coatings for mass-produced cellullose sponges to transform them into sorbents for remediating heavy metals and recovering critical elements from aqueous sources.  We called this platform approach "Nano-SCHeMe": Nanomaterial Sponge Coatings for Heavy Metals.

This work was published in [_ACS ES&T Water_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00646) and reported on by [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90895209/sponge-cleans-lead-drinking-water?partner=rss), [New Atlas](https://newatlas.com/environment/nanoparticle-sponge-heavy-metals-water/), and [Northwestern Now](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/05/metal-filtering-sponge-removes-lead-from-water/), and presented on at meetings of the American Chemical Society.

Previously, I had worked under lead author, Stephanie Ribet, on the Phosphate Elimination and Recovery Lightweight (PEARL) Membrane, a sustainable solution to the [problem of phosphate pollution](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/phosphorus-pollution-fertilizer/617937/) and hypereutrophication. A cellulose sponge, coated with a nanomaterial slurry, can recover phosphorus, an essential nutrient, from wastewater.  Our work was published in [_PNAS_](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2102583118) and reported on by [Anthropocene](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2021/06/a-nanoscale-solution-to-a-gigaton-problem/), [New Atlas](https://newatlas.com/environment/adaptable-sponge-phosphate-polluted-waterways-reuse/), and the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9637929/Scientists-create-sponge-soak-phosphate-reused.html).

We more recently continued the testing of the PEARL membrane at larger scales to bridge the gap between lab-scale science and field-scale technology.  Working under lead author Kelly Matuszewski, our work on utilizing pH to differentially recover metals and nutrients concurrently from stormwater is published in [_ES&T Water_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.4c01234) and reported on by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauriewinkless/2025/02/12/specialist-sponge-captures-valuable-minerals-from-polluted-storm-water/).
