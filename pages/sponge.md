# Nanomaterial Sponge Coatings for Heavy Metal Remediation

After the previous successes of my lab group in using sponge nanocomposites for oil spill remediation and nutrient recovery, I worked on designing nanomaterial coatings for mass-produced cellullose sponges to transform them into sorbents for remediating heavy metals and recovering critical elements from aqueous sources.  We called this platform approach "Nano-SCHeMe": Nanomaterial Sponge Coatings for Heavy Metals.

This work was published in [_ACS ES&T Water_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00646) and reported on by [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90895209/sponge-cleans-lead-drinking-water?partner=rss), [New Atlas](https://newatlas.com/environment/nanoparticle-sponge-heavy-metals-water/), and [Northwestern Now](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/05/metal-filtering-sponge-removes-lead-from-water/), and presented on at meetings of the American Chemical Society.
