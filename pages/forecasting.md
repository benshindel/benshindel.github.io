# Forecasting Work

After a couple years of experience as a competitive forecasting hobbyist, I am now serving as a Pro Forecaster with the [RAND Forecasting Initiative](https://www.rand.org/global-and-emerging-risks/forecasting-initiative.html).  I also write a weekly newsletter, [Above the Fold](https://news.manifold.markets/), for the largest play-money prediction market in the world, [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/), where I discuss how the week's global news and developments can be interpreted by prediction markets.

I am top 40 in the all-time leaderboard on Manifold Markets, and also a [top 20](https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/123595/) forecaster on [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/), where I placed 2nd and 4th in the last two quarterly tournaments out of hundreds of competitors.  I also have experience [running a forecasting tournament](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/you-can-just-run-contests) in my graduate school's engineering department.

Some of my favorite Manifold markets that I'm currently running are:
- Can someone persuade me to [resolve this market](https://manifold.markets/bens/i-will-resolve-this-market-no-at-th) YES by the end of June?
- Will someone [figure out the purpose](https://manifold.markets/bens/will-someone-figure-out-what-my-now) of my hostile wooden cube by the end of the year?
- Will there be [ubiquitous AI babysitters](https://manifold.markets/bens/will-this-yudkowsky-tweet-on-ai-bab) / childcare by early 2028?
- Will [autonomous driving rideshares](https://manifold.markets/bens/will-autonomous-driving-rideshares) exceed human-driven rideshares by 2030?
