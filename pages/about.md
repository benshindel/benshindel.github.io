# About Me 
    
Welcome to my website, I'm Ben, an engineer currently supporting the Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Lab. I spent about half of the last decade [completing a PhD](https://vpd.ms.northwestern.edu/) in materials science at [Northwestern](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science/), where I [researched](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eggCpdkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) adsorbent materials for [water remediation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00646) and [carbon capture](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c02543). Over my five years at Northwestern, I served as a fellow with the [Brady Program in Ethics and Civic Life](https://bradyprogram.northwestern.edu/), mentored half a dozen [students](https://shyne.northwestern.edu/reu/) and [Chicago-area teachers](https://shyne.northwestern.edu/ret/) through summer research programs, attended [COP28](https://nuance.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2024/2024-01-25-vpd-student-attends-un-climate-conference.html) with the American Chemical Society's delegation, and completed a certificate program through the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/services-support/professional-development/mse/).

I'm also a forecasting enthusiast; you can often find me predicting on [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/123595/) and [Manifold](https://manifold.markets/benshindel). In my free time, I write fiction, construct [crosswords](https://crosshare.org/benshindel), and play basketball at my county gym.
