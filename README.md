I vibecoded this website from scratch. It was a rewarding process, and let me build exactly the kind of website I wanted to.  If you have any recommendations for my site, please let me know!  The url is www.benshindel.com

This website uses Github's native Jekyll integration.
- The _includes folder contains the header.html and footer.html of the website.
- The _layouts folder contains the default.html layout for the pages on this website.
- The assets folder holds images and textfiles used by the website, as well as the style.css file and .js scripts to power the lightmode/darkmode toggle, the randomized .svg sprites in the footer, and the mobile hamburger-style dropdown menu.
- The pages folder contains each of the markdown pages on the website.
- The _config.yml file helps Github use Jekyll to build the site.
- The index.md is the markdown file for the main page at www.benshindel.com
